This is a fully completed template to get you started quickly. 

## There are 5 current tools integrated into the application that you can copy and edit to create additional tools. 
1. Text Box - Provides a simple method to collect user supplied information. 
2. Find Files - Does a search in a specified folder for a specified string and returns that data in a table.
3. Create Folders - Creates 6 folders in target directories and then does a check to confirm the process.
4. Count Transactions - Integrates with a SQL Server command sent ata a specified SQL Instance and returns the resuls in a grid view. 
5. Create Web Page - Uses SQL Server to return query data and then uses that data to build a web page.

Yes you ead that last one correctly, the report builds a web page with data returned from SQL Server :-)
